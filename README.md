# warframe.market-api-example
An example on how to do authorized requests with the warframe.market API.

## Why?
I was unfamiliar with this and it took me ages to figure out. The documentation didn't really help and I couldn't find any good examples. If you're here you're probably in the same spot I was in. Have fun coding.

## Getting your token
1. Use your favorite browser (e.g. Firefox or Chrome)
2. Log into warframe.market (if you aren't already)
3. Pull up the developer console (ctrl + shift + i)
4. Navigate to the tab "Storage"
5. Click on the "Cookies" storage
6. Go the cookies for the warframe.market domain
7. Select the cookie called "JWT" (that stands for JSON Web Token)
8. Copy the value of the JWT cookie
9. Paste the value into token.json (needs to be a string)

## Documentation
Official API documentation (because it's not easy to find):
* [Link to the full v1 documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1121cjBNN4BeZdMBGil6Qbuqse-sWpEXPpitQH5fb_Fo/)
* [Link to a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bbbbhe9nY4XvUG8yzUj-GaSVkQIqg1bPS5jpFg_wI0/) - This is just a document with a link to the first document, no need to click this. *Maybe this is where v2 docs will be in the future.*

## Support
I'm not gonna help you with this, you're on your own. The warframe.market Discord has a support channel though.
